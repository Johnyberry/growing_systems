# Title

This pluggin is developing a software application that utilizes a modular growing system for large-scale site planning. The software will incorporate master program principles to create an organizational growing system, which can be applied to the design of cities. By capturing data from the city under study, the modular components of the growing system will be able to adapt and grow dynamically, resulting in a more efficient and effective planning process.
